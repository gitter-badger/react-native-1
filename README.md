## What is React Native?
React Native is a new language for mobile app development that lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI using declarative components.  It works for both IOS and android, and you can test your codes directly on your phone through the Expo CLI API.  No need for simulators anymore.  Apps that use React Native include: Instagram, Facebook, Uber, Skype, etc.
