## What is React Native?
React Native is a new language for mobile app development that lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI using declarative components.  It works for both IOS and android, and you can test your codes __directly on your phone__ through the Expo CLI API.  No need for simulators anymore.  

Apps that use React Native include: __Instagram, Facebook, Uber, Skype, etc.__

## Getting Started
1. Install Nodes here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Then run ```npm install -g expo-cli```
  
    While it's installing, go ahead and install Expo CLI from app store on your phone.

3. Next, clone the repo to your local computer:
```git clone https://github.com/michiganhackers/react-native.git```

4. Then cd into the react-native folder you just cloned and type ```npm install``` to install all required packages

5. Enter ```npm start```

6. Scan the QR code with your phone's camera and the app should be up and running.
